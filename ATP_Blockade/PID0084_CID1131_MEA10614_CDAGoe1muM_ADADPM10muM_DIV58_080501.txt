02.05.08
PID0084
CID1131

Filter: 200Hz HP
Theta:  4.7Std, no manual correction

AC:   46
SNR: good

Activity: regular short and high frequent bursts interspersed 
with uncorrelated(?) single spiking on some channels

1) Control
2 channels with bad SNR (see Rack file)

2) DPM 1muM (added 10mul of 100muM solution)
threahold adjusted 

3) DPM 3muM (added 20mul of 100muM solution)


4) DPM 10muM (added 7mul of 1mM solution)

5) DPM 30muM (added 20mul of 1mM solution)

6) NMDA 1muM (added 10mul of 100muM solution)
culture bursts one several channels but activity decays successively - culture dies
--> Excitotoxic concentration!!!
added 10muM IFP: induces single spiking on some channels again but only transiently
added 30muM IFP: induces single spiking on some channels again but only transiently
added 10muM BIC: no effect
stimulation does not evoke any response
