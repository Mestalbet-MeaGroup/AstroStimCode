Control recording

Offline analysis:
early to fire electrodes = 12,17,(21),71
not so early electrodes  = 26,66
late electrodes  = 57,65

2) Stimulation 1
PID0087_CID1167_CAGoe1muM_AAControl_DIV95_080722_stim1.mcd
stimulation with protocol: Stim1_ISI5s_thetadetection.stm
25x[-100,-200,-300,-400,-500,-600,-700,-800] = 200 pulses.

early to fire electrodes ...
1. stimulation electrode: 12 (triggerid   1-200)
	~ reliable responses at -500mV. Stim frequency of 0.2 Hz results in 		very little spontaneous activity during the stimulation period.
2. stimulation electrode: 17 (triggerid 201-400)

3. stimulation electrode: 71 (triggerid 401-600)


intermediate to fire electrodes ...

4. stimulation electrode: 26 (triggerid 601-800)

observation: when the stimulus is started after some time of spontaneous activity the first low amplitude pulses already evoke responses. After some time only amplitudes above -500mV evoke responses...

5. stimulation electrode: 66 (triggerid 801-1000)


late to fire electrodes ...

6. stimulation electrode: 57 (triggerid 1001-1200)

7. stimulation electrode: 65 (triggerid 1201-1400)

10mul 1mM Dipyridamole --> ~ 10muM

4) Pharmacology

+10mul 1mM Ifenprodil --> ~ 10muM
no spontaneous activity within the first 5mins after application.
rare synchronised single Spiking on a subset of electodes afterwards

recorded ~1600s then started with the stimulation


5) Stimulation 2
early to fire electrodes ...
1. stimulation electrode: 12 (triggerid   1-96)
almost no response
Goe cultures may have weak synapses and therefore ar shut down already at low concentrations ... next time: start with 1muM IFP & DPM
aborted - no responses
