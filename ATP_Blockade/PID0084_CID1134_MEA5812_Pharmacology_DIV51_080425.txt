bursts shorten - interburst periods are
increasingly filled with single asynchronous spiking

Experiment
Acute application of dipyramidol results in the following effects based on mechanisms 
proposed in the following:
Bursts shorten due to increased ATP mediated synaptic shortterm supression 
and interburstintervalls shorten due to decreased adensosine mediated longterm
synaptic supression. Interburst intervalls reveal increased asynchronous single spiking.
Burst sometimes are reduced to single spikes. Remaining network bursting and network wide
synchronous events could be evoked by strong common input via Glial cells.

Idea 
- Increase excitability with Bicucullin to increase the proportion of interburst spiking
- desynchronise input by gap junction blockers (Mefloquine 1-3muM)
- take out common drive by ifenprodil

Analysis:
Look at correlations within the interburst periods.
Could be a good way to compare Goe treated cultures and controls.
Determine correlation vs. distance for all electrode combinations



Comments:
Waehrend des Versuchs bohren und haemmern die Handwerker wie gestoert an der 
zum Nachbarraum angrenzenden Wand und erschuettern diese merklich!
Man sieht jedoch auf Anhieb erst mal nichts in den Signalen...
